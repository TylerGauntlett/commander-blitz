 * The dev server proxies /api and /health to the FastAPI process, so the client

 *
 * `host` is pinned to 127.0.0.1 on purpose. Vite's default is "localhost",
 * which Node 17+ resolves to ::1 and then binds IPv6-only -- so anything asking
 * for 127.0.0.1 (Playwright's health check, curl, the engine's CORS origins)
 * gets connection refused against a server that is plainly running.

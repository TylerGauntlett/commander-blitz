# Writing a card

Cards are JSON. There is no Python in a card file, no `eval`, and no escape hatch —
which means a card either uses vocabulary the engine implements, or it fails to load.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    json["cards/*.cards.json"] --> pydantic["schema.py<br/>shape validation"]
    pydantic --> vocab["loader.py<br/>vocabulary validation"]
    vocab --> constraints["loader.py<br/>constraint checks"]
    constraints --> carddef["CardDef<br/>immutable"]
    carddef --> ability["Ability"]
    ability --> ctx["EffectContext<br/>targets, bindings, x"]
    ctx --> ops["op registry<br/>38 ops"]
    ops --> events["GameEvent log"]

    style vocab fill:#2d5a8c,color:#fff
    style constraints fill:#2d5a8c,color:#fff
```

The two blue steps are the point: **an unknown op name, selector key, keyword, type or
trigger event is an error at load time**, so a typo fails the test suite rather than
silently producing a card that looks implemented and does nothing.

## The shape of a card

```jsonc
{
  "id": "snake_case_id",          // required, unique
  "name": "Display Name",         // required, unique among non-tokens
  "oracle_text": "...",           // display only
  "mana_cost": "{4}{G}{U}",       // omit for lands
  "supertypes": ["Legendary"],
  "types": ["Creature"],          // required
  "subtypes": ["Serpent"],
  "power": 5, "toughness": 5,     // required for creatures
  "keywords": ["trample"],
  "colors": ["G"],                // defaults to the colours in the cost
  "color_identity": ["G", "U"],   // defaults to derived; override for Command Tower etc.
  "targets": [ ... ],             // spell-level targets
  "spell_effects": [ ... ],       // what an instant/sorcery does on resolution
  "replacements": [ ... ],        // whitelist only
  "abilities": [ ... ],           // activated | triggered | static
  "is_token": false
}
```

## Effect ops

42 of them. Each takes a spec dict; the common fields are `objects` (a selector),
`player` (a player spec) and `amount` (a value expression).

| Group | Ops |
|---|---|
| Cards | `draw` `discard` `mill` `search_library` `return_to_hand` `return_from_graveyard` `reveal` `scry` `surveil` `shuffle` `put_on_top` |
| Board | `destroy` `exile` `sacrifice` `put_onto_battlefield` `create_token` `add_counters` `remove_counters` `tap` `untap` `attach` `lock_abilities` `monstrosity` `freeze` |
| Modify | `pump` `grant_keyword` `set_pt` |
| Life & damage | `gain_life` `lose_life` `damage` |
| Mana | `add_mana` `add_mana_per` `extra_land_drop` |
| Stack | `counter` |
| Control flow | `if` `for_each` `may` `choose_mode` `repeat` `snapshot` `noop` `delay` |

## Selectors — "which objects"

Every key is optional; all present keys must match.

```jsonc
{
  "zone": "battlefield",          // library|hand|battlefield|graveyard|exile|stack|command
  "controller": "you",            // you|opponent|any
  "types": ["Creature"],          // all must be present
  "not_types": ["Artifact"],
  "subtypes": ["Vampire"],        // any one is enough
  "supertypes": ["Basic"],
  "colors": ["B"], "keywords": ["flying"],
  "tapped": false, "attacking": true, "blocking": false,
  "is_commander": false, "is_token": false, "damaged": true,
  "power":      { "op": ">=", "value": { "const": 3 } },
  "toughness":  { "op": "<=", "value": { "const": 2 } },
  "mana_value": { "op": "<=", "value": { "const": 3 } },
  "exclude_self": true,           // "other ... you control"
  "self_only": true,              // this permanent only
  "count": 1,                     // an int, or "all"
  "chooser": "controller",        // controller|owner|none
  "random": false,
  "name": "Forest"
}
```

Two shorthands name a pool directly instead of searching a zone:

```jsonc
{ "target": "t1" }       // whatever was chosen for target spec t1
{ "binding": "subject" } // the object a trigger bound (the land that was played, ...)
```

On their own they *are* the whole selector. Combined with other keys they are the
**source** and the rest still filters, which is how a card asks a question about
one particular card rather than about a zone:

```jsonc
// Coiling Oracle: is the card I just bound a land?
{ "op": "snapshot", "as": "top_card", "objects": { "zone": "library", "controller": "you" } },
{ "op": "if",
  "condition": { "exists": { "binding": "top_card", "zone": "library", "types": ["Land"] } },
  "then": [ { "op": "put_onto_battlefield", "objects": { "binding": "top_card" } } ],
  "else": [ { "op": "return_to_hand",       "objects": { "binding": "top_card" } } ] }
```

Without that, the nearest thing a card could ask was "is there a land *somewhere*
in my library", which is true almost always and would have made the branch a
formality. Note the explicit `"zone": "library"` — filtering defaults to the
battlefield, and a card being asked about anywhere else has to say so.

## Value expressions

Anywhere a number is expected:

```jsonc
{ "const": 3 }
{ "x": true }                                   // the X paid when cast
{ "count": { "controller": "you", "subtypes": ["Vampire"] } }
{ "power_of": { "var": "victim" } }             // from a snapshot
{ "toughness_of": { "target": "t1" } }
{ "mana_value_of": { "target": "t1" } }
{ "life_of": "you" }
{ "cards_in_hand": "each_opponent" }
{ "binding": "amount" }                         // a value the trigger carried
{ "counters_on": { "counter": "+1/+1", "objects": { "self_only": true } } }
{ "sum": [a, b] } { "minus": [a, b] } { "times": [a, b] } { "max": [...] } { "min": [...] }
```

## Player specs

`"you"` · `"opponent"` / `"each_opponent"` · `"each_player"` · `"active_player"` ·
`{ "target": "t1" }` · `{ "controller_of": "snapshot_name" }` ·
`{ "owner_of": "snapshot_name" }`

## Conditions

```jsonc
{ "cmp": ">=", "left": {...}, "right": {...} }
{ "all": [...] }  { "any": [...] }  { "not": {...} }
{ "exists": { selector } }
{ "zone_is": "battlefield" }
{ "is_your_turn": true }
```

## Triggers

```jsonc
{
  "kind": "triggered",
  "active_zones": ["battlefield"],   // add "command" for eminence-style abilities
  "trigger": {
    "event": "permanent_enters",
    "controller": "you",             // whose action must it be
    "source": "self",                // restrict to this permanent
    "filter": { "types": ["Land"] }, // a selector applied to the event's subject
    "condition": { ... },            // intervening "if", re-checked on resolution
    "defending": "you"               // `attacks` only: whom it is attacking
  },
  "effects": [ ... ]
}
```

`defending` is **not** a synonym for `controller`. `controller` says whose
creature is swinging; `defending` says who is being swung at. "Whenever a
creature attacks you" needs the second, and in a duel the two are
indistinguishable — which is exactly why writing it with `controller:
"opponent"` looks right until a pod draws you a card for a combat you were not
in. The loader rejects `defending` on any other event rather than ignoring it.

Events: `self_enters` · `permanent_enters` · `dies` · `creature_dies` ·
`leaves_battlefield` · `land_played` · `spell_cast` · `attacks` · `blocks` ·
`deals_combat_damage_to_player` · `upkeep` · `draw_step` · `begin_combat` ·
`end_step` · `you_gain_life` · `counter_placed` · `draw`

Triggers carry bindings the effects can read: `subject` (the object the event was
about), `amount` (damage dealt, life gained), `self`, `x`, `defender` (the player
attacked), and `was_attacking` on `leaves_battlefield`.

`was_attacking` is 1 or 0 rather than a boolean, so it reads with the ordinary
`{"binding": "was_attacking"}` value expression and needs no new condition
vocabulary:

```jsonc
{ "op": "if",
  "condition": { "cmp": ">=", "left": { "binding": "was_attacking" },
                 "right": { "const": 1 } },
  "then": [ { "op": "draw", "player": "you", "amount": { "const": 1 } } ],
  "else": [ { "op": "lose_life", "player": "each_opponent", "amount": { "const": 1 } } ] }
```

It is last-known information and has to be: by the time the trigger resolves the
object is out of combat and there is nothing left to ask. It is snapshotted where
`was_creature` already was — the one LKI case a card cannot reach with a
`snapshot` op of its own, because the object has already gone.

## Static abilities

Parameters are flattened onto the ability, and the filter may only read **printed**
characteristics — the loader rejects anything else. See
[engine-rules.md](engine-rules.md#derived-characteristics-layers-lite) for why.

```jsonc
{ "kind": "static", "effect": "buff",
  "affects": { "controller": "you", "subtypes": ["Vampire"], "exclude_self": true },
  "power": { "const": 1 }, "toughness": { "const": 1 } }
```

Effects: `buff` · `grant_keyword` · `set_pt` · `add_subtype` · `set_types` ·
`extra_land_drops`, plus the player-wide ones below.
Values inside a static may only be `{"const": n}` or `{"count": filter}`.

`set_types` **replaces** the printed types rather than adding to them —
Arixmethes is "a land (it's not a creature)", which `add_subtype` cannot say. A
`{"count": filter}` value is also how a creature printed `*/*` works:

```jsonc
{ "kind": "static", "effect": "set_pt", "affects": { "self_only": true },
  "power":     { "count": { "controller": "you", "types": ["Land"] } },
  "toughness": { "count": { "controller": "you", "types": ["Land"] } } }
```

### "As long as…"

A static may carry a `condition`, and it may ask exactly one question: how many
counters of a kind sit on **its own source**.

```jsonc
{ "kind": "static", "effect": "set_types",
  "affects": { "self_only": true }, "types": ["Land"],
  "condition": { "counters": { "counter": "slumber", "op": ">=", "amount": 1 } } }
```

Deliberately that small, and for the same reason `affects` filters are: counters
are board state, so a condition cannot depend on another static's output and the
fixed-order pipeline stays acyclic.

## Worked examples

A basic land:

```json
{
  "id": "island", "name": "Island",
  "supertypes": ["Basic"], "types": ["Land"], "subtypes": ["Island"],
  "abilities": [
    { "kind": "activated", "is_mana_ability": true,
      "cost": { "tap": true },
      "effects": [{ "op": "add_mana", "mana": "{U}" }] }
  ]
}
```

A commander with a trigger and a static, plus a command-zone ability:

```json
{
  "id": "aesi_tyrant_of_gyre_strait", "name": "Aesi, Tyrant of Gyre Strait",
  "mana_cost": "{4}{G}{U}",
  "supertypes": ["Legendary"], "types": ["Creature"], "subtypes": ["Serpent"],
  "power": 5, "toughness": 5, "keywords": ["trample"],
  "abilities": [
    { "kind": "triggered",
      "trigger": { "event": "land_played", "controller": "you" },
      "effects": [{ "op": "draw", "player": "you", "amount": { "const": 1 } }] },
    { "kind": "static", "effect": "extra_land_drops",
      "affects_player": "you", "amount": { "const": 1 } }
  ]
}
```

Last-known information, made explicit:

```json
{
  "id": "swords_to_plowshares", "name": "Swords to Plowshares",
  "oracle_text": "Exile target creature. Its controller gains life equal to its power.",
  "mana_cost": "{W}", "types": ["Instant"],
  "targets": [
    { "id": "t1", "kind": "permanent",
      "selector": { "zone": "battlefield", "types": ["Creature"] }, "count": 1 }
  ],
  "spell_effects": [
    { "op": "snapshot", "target": "t1", "as": "victim" },
    { "op": "exile", "objects": { "target": "t1" } },
    { "op": "gain_life",
      "player": { "controller_of": "victim" },
      "amount": { "power_of": { "var": "victim" } } }
  ]
}
```

Without the `snapshot`, the creature would already be gone by the time the life gain
is computed. Declaring it is the engine's substitute for a general LKI system.

## Making a token that is already attacking

```jsonc
{ "op": "create_token", "token": "warrior_1_1_r",
  "amount": { "const": 1 }, "tapped": true, "attacking": true }
```

`attacking` puts the token into combat against **whoever the source is already
attacking**, which is what a mobilize-style trigger means. Outside combat, or
from a source that is not itself attacking, there is nobody to join and the
token simply arrives (tapped, if asked).

A token created this way was never *declared* as an attacker, so it triggers
nothing that fires on attacking. That is the real rule, and it is also what keeps
"whenever this attacks, make a token that is attacking" from making tokens
forever.

## Mana abilities

A mana ability must contain only `add_mana`, or a single `choose_mode` whose modes each
contain only `add_mana`. The loader enforces this, and it is why a dual land never stops
to ask which colour: the payment solver picks the mode, records the option index, and
the engine adds exactly that mana without running the effect interpreter at all.

## Adding an op

1. Write the function in the right `effects/ops_*.py` and decorate it with
   `@register("name")`. Make it a generator if it needs a decision.
2. Add a unit test.
3. That is all — the loader now accepts it, and card files can use it.

## Generated cards, and promoting one

Deck import writes card files too. `src/automtg/cards/proxy.py` turns a catalog
row into a `CardModel` for a card nobody wrote rules for: real name, cost, types,
stats, colours, the keywords the engine implements, and a `{T}: Add` mana ability
where there is one. **Everything else its printed text claims does nothing**, and
every such simplification is recorded and shown at import.

Those land in `data/generated/cards/pool.cards.json`, which is gitignored and is
**not** loaded by `default_registry()` — see [deck-import.md](deck-import.md) for
why that separation is load-bearing.

The generator emits a `CardModel` and runs it through the same `compile_card`
above, so it gets the identical vocabulary and constraint validation, and a
generator bug is a `DslError` at import time rather than a card that looks
implemented and does nothing.

That also gives a **promotion path**, which is how the proxy backlog gets burnt
down one card at a time:

1. Find the card in `data/generated/cards/pool.cards.json`. It is already in
   this file format.
2. Move the object into an authored file in `data/cards/`.
3. Fill in its `abilities` / `spell_effects` by hand, using everything above.
4. Delete it from the pool.

It is now a first-class card with the full test suite behind it, and every deck
that references that id picks up the real rules on the next import.

## Auras and Equipment

An Aura's "Enchant creature" line is not an ability — it is the spell's
targeting clause, so it is written as a `target` and the engine attaches the
permanent to what it targeted once it is on the battlefield:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "pacifism", "name": "Pacifism", "mana_cost": "{1}{W}",
  "types": ["Enchantment"], "subtypes": ["Aura"],
  "targets": [
    { "id": "t1", "kind": "permanent",
      "selector": { "zone": "battlefield", "types": ["Creature"] }, "count": 1 }
  ],
  "abilities": [
    { "kind": "static", "text": "Enchanted creature gets -2/-0.",
      "effect": "buff", "affects": { "attached": true },
      "power": { "const": -2 }, "toughness": { "const": 0 } }
  ]
}
```

`{"attached": true}` means "the permanent this is attached to". It is checked
before `controller` and short-circuits it, because an Aura on an opponent's
creature still affects that creature and the default `controller: "you"` would
quietly stop it.

Equipment needs nothing new — `Equip {2}` is an ordinary sorcery-speed activated
ability whose effect is `attach`:

```jsonc
{ "kind": "activated", "text": "Equip {1}", "sorcery_speed_only": true,
  "cost": { "mana": "{1}" },
  "targets": [ { "id": "t1", "kind": "permanent",
    "selector": { "zone": "battlefield", "controller": "you", "types": ["Creature"] },
    "count": 1 } ],
  "effects": [ { "op": "attach", "objects": { "target": "t1" } } ] }
```

Attaching during an Aura's `spell_effects` does **not** work, and the failure is
silent: `move_object` calls `reset_permanent_state` on the way onto the
battlefield, which clears `attached_to`, so the Aura arrives enchanting nothing
and state-based actions put it in the graveyard.

## Player-wide statics

Five static effects describe the *player* rather than a characteristic, so they
take `affects_player` instead of `affects`:

```jsonc
{ "kind": "static", "effect": "extra_land_drops",
  "affects_player": "you", "amount": { "const": 1 } }
{ "kind": "static", "effect": "no_hand_limit", "affects_player": "you" }
{ "kind": "static", "effect": "play_lands_from_graveyard", "affects_player": "you" }
{ "kind": "static", "effect": "play_lands_from_library_top", "affects_player": "you" }
{ "kind": "static", "effect": "double_land_triggers", "affects_player": "you" }
```

`double_land_triggers` is Ancient Greenwarden: a land entering makes each of your
permanents' triggers fire an additional time. Read by `triggers.collect`, which
queues the ability **twice** rather than resolving it twice — the two copies are
separate abilities on the stack and anything in between still goes between them.

The two land permissions widen *where* a land may be played from, never how
many — `lands_played` still enforces one drop a turn, so Ramunap Excavator plus
Dryad of the Ilysian Grove is two drops from anywhere, which is correct.

`play_lands_from_library_top` offers the top card only. That is what the cards
say, and it is also the only part of a hidden zone anybody is entitled to see.

## "Sacrifice it unless you…"

`may` takes an `else`, and that is what turns an optional effect into a cost:

```jsonc
{ "op": "if",
  "condition": { "exists": { "zone": "battlefield", "controller": "you",
                             "subtypes": ["Island"], "tapped": false } },
  "then": [ { "op": "may",
              "prompt": "Return an untapped Island you control to its owner's hand?",
              "effects": [ { "op": "return_to_hand", "objects": { ... } } ],
              "else":    [ { "op": "sacrifice", "objects": { "self_only": true } } ] } ],
  "else": [ { "op": "sacrifice", "objects": { "self_only": true } } ] }
```

The outer `exists` guard is not optional bookkeeping. Without it the card offers
a "may" that can be accepted when there is nothing to return, and a Karoo land
that never costs anything is simply a better card than the one printed — the
failure this whole format exists to refuse.

`may` also takes `condition` (ask only while it holds) and `repeat` (ask again
after each yes, stop at the first no), which together are "…if you do, draw a
card and **repeat this process**":

```jsonc
{ "op": "may", "repeat": true,
  "prompt": "Put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield tapped?",
  "condition": { "exists": { "zone": "hand", "controller": "you", "types": ["Land"] } },
  "effects": [ { "op": "put_onto_battlefield", "objects": { ... }, "tapped": true },
               { "op": "draw", "player": "you", "amount": { "const": 1 } } ] }
```

A loop rather than a counted `repeat` because the number of iterations is not
knowable up front — Cultivator Colossus draws into the lands it is putting down —
and because a counted version would let a player decline and then accept, which
the printed card does not. Bounded at 100 iterations, like `repeat`.

## Modal spells with a target

`choose_mode` picks its mode as the spell resolves (a
[documented simplification](rules-coverage.md)), but a spell's *targets* are
chosen when it is cast. Where the modes point at different things, that gap is
closed by declaring one **optional** target that the modes that need it share:

```jsonc
"targets": [
  { "id": "t1", "kind": "permanent", "count": 1, "optional": true,
    "selector": { "zone": "battlefield", "types": ["Creature"] } }
],
"spell_effects": [
  { "op": "choose_mode", "count": 1, "modes": [
    { "label": "Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn",
      "effects": [ { "op": "pump", "objects": { "target": "t1" }, ... } ] },
    { "label": "Permanents you control gain hexproof until end of turn",
      "effects": [ { "op": "grant_keyword", ... } ] },
    { "label": "Return target creature to its owner's hand",
      "effects": [ { "op": "return_to_hand", "objects": { "target": "t1" } } ] }
  ] }
]
```

`optional: true` is what makes Simic Charm castable with no creature anywhere —
its second mode needs no target, and without the flag the card would vanish from
the hand's legal actions exactly when that mode is the one you want.

Gate 5 of the authoring verifier drives the **first** mode only, so a modal card
wants a unit test per mode; `tests/unit/test_modal_spells.py` is the pattern.

## Monstrosity, and holding creatures down

```jsonc
{ "op": "monstrosity", "amount": { "const": 4 } }
```

Puts the counters on and sets a one-way `monstrous` flag. The flag *is* the
mechanic: without it the ability is a repeatable pump and the
`becomes_monstrous` trigger fires every time instead of once.

```jsonc
{ "op": "freeze", "objects": { "target": "t1" } }
```

"…don't untap during their controllers' untap steps for as long as you control
this creature." The frozen permanent records the **oid of the source** rather
than a flag with a lifetime of its own, because the hold has to end when the
source leaves and pointing at it is the only way the untap step can tell.

## "Its activated abilities can't be activated this turn"

```jsonc
{ "op": "lock_abilities", "objects": { "target": "t1" } }
```

An until-end-of-turn effect, so the cleanup step already removes it. It is
deliberately *not* a keyword: a keyword is a characteristic and would show in the
card's keyword list, and this is a permission. It is read by `legality` and by
the mana solver — mana abilities are activated abilities too, and a locked land
that still tapped for mana would make the effect worth nothing.

## Cost reduction

```jsonc
{ "id": "ghalta_primal_hunger", "mana_cost": "{10}{G}{G}",
  "cost_reduction": { "total_power": { "controller": "you", "types": ["Creature"] } } }
```

Also `{"count": filter}`, for "costs {1} less for each…". Generic only, clamped
at zero: "costs {X} less" never reaches through the generic part into the
coloured pips, which is both the rule and the only thing the payment solver could
act on. Mana value stays what is printed.

Read off the board every time it is asked for, never stored — Ghalta is a
twelve-drop or a two-drop depending on what is already in play. Legality and
payment both call `costs.cost_reduction`, because a reduction one of them knows
about and the other does not is the difference between an uncastable card and a
free one.

The filter may only read printed characteristics, like a static's: it is
evaluated while deciding what is castable, before anything is on the stack.

## Kicker

An additional cost the caster may choose to pay. Two fields, and they only mean
anything together:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "into_the_roil",
  "mana_cost": "{1}{U}",
  "kicker": "{1}{U}",
  "spell_effects": [
    { "op": "return_to_hand", "objects": { "target": "t1" } },
    { "op": "if", "condition": { "kicked": true },
      "then": [ { "op": "draw", "player": "you", "amount": { "const": 1 } } ] }
  ]
}
```

Legality offers a kickable card **twice** — unkicked first, then kicked, when the
extra mana is there — and the two are different actions, not one action with a
flag the client sets. `kicker` is deliberately not folded into `mana_cost`: mana
value stays what is printed, and the choice is the mechanic.

The loader rejects **half** a kicker in either direction: a `kicker` cost that no
effect reads via `kicked`, and a `kicked` condition on a card with no `kicker`.
One is a spell that charges more and does the same thing; the other is a clause
that can never fire. Both load cleanly and neither shows on the board, which is
why they are caught at load time.

Gate 5 of the authoring verifier measures a kicker card **kicked**, because that
is the strictly larger claim; gate 4 still casts it unkicked, so neither line
goes unexercised.

## Delayed triggers — "at the beginning of the next …"

Every other trigger in the engine fires *from* an event that has just happened.
This is the other shape: an effect that has already resolved arranging for
something to happen later, with no object left to hang a trigger on. Arcane
Denial is the whole argument for it — without the delayed draws it is a strictly
worse Counterspell, and nothing on screen would say so.

```jsonc
{ "op": "delay", "step": "upkeep",
  "text": "At the beginning of the next turn's upkeep, draw a card.",
  "effects": [ { "op": "draw", "player": "you", "amount": { "const": 1 } } ] }
```

`step` is one of `upkeep` · `draw_step` · `begin_combat` · `end_step`, checked at
load time like every other piece of vocabulary: a misspelled step would schedule
something that never comes due.

Two things are worth knowing before writing one:

- **Bindings are captured when it is scheduled**, not when it fires. That is the
  point — by the time it fires, the object it was about may be in another zone.
  `{"binding": "how_many"}` inside the scheduled effects reads the value the
  scheduling effect had.
- **It waits for the step's *next* occurrence.** `begin_step` for the current
  step has already run by the time any effect resolves, so scheduling `upkeep`
  during an upkeep means the following turn's, which is what the cards say.

The scheduled effects resolve directly rather than going on the stack. That is a
divergence — a delayed trigger is a real triggered ability and should be
respondable — recorded with the other simplifications in
[rules-coverage.md](rules-coverage.md).

## "This spell can't be countered"

A flag on the card, not an ability:

```jsonc
{ "id": "koma_cosmos_serpent", "uncounterable": true, ... }
```

It has to be, because a spell is on the stack and static abilities do not reach
it there. The `counter` op checks it and emits a `spell_countered` event carrying
`failed: "cannot be countered"`, so the log says what happened rather than the
spell silently surviving.
